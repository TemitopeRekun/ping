## Overview
- This is a perfect challenge for beginners who wants to test their HTML, CSS  and JAVASCRIPT skills. It involves basic styling of the page, hover effects and email validation.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

- Started with writing the markup.
- styled the markup with CSS.
- Added functionality to the markup usng JavaScript. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Being my first JavaScript project, i learnt the practical aspect of form validation using condition statements.

### Continued development

I will continue to work on Javascript form validation using conditional statements

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to use critical thinking when coding condition statments. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Telusko channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Telusko) - This channel has an amazing series on JavaScript which helped me finally understand condition statement. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
